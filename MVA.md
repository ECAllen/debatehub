# MVA

## Strategy 
### Ladder up 

Netflix example: Walmart movies -> DVDs -> streaming -> content

Dont look at the business you want to build but rather the business you can start today

suggested ladder: 
rung 1 - minimum viable audience as opposed to mvp, let audience dictate mvp
rung 2 - build product get to 6 figures
rung 3 - build real business to get to 7 figures

rung 1 (MVA)
3 to 6 months to get 2,000 email subs, you can use mailchimp, drip.co ...
if you cant get people to follow your blog then probably wont have marketing chops to to build a product

howto chooose audience:
	go with your passion
	would you be comfortable sharing with friends and family?
	do you use it?

Kevin Kelly essay 1,000 true fans

2,000 subscribers is good # bc can be potentially be 2$ per subscriber per month

dont worry about selling product yet except maybe consulting

this phase to develope marketing in a way to get audience to comment and subscribe

work on messaging

use this phase as research and pain points

most people overestimate how hard it is to get someone to subscribe but underestimate how easy it is to get someone to buy product

### Funnel

subscribe -> choose one of three pdfs -> coming soon Patreon

three pdfs:
	Long term trends and threats to freedom
	2017 year preview
	??? Future of discourse and trends in the electorate

Story: Born in the Midwest but moved to a mid-sized city. Has a bachelor's degree. He was smart enough to get an advanced degree but wanted to do something practical. He might also be skilled in a trade and own a small service business. He feels out of sorts with his times. He feels that there are posibilities that are not being realized. He also has the vague feeling that society could turn. He is not a survivalist but he sympathizes with them and has done light prepping. He has flirted with some left wing ideals when he was young and then drifted toward libertarianism. He realizes the the liberty parties are not the answer but he is sympathich with them and feels like they have some of the answers. He is searching. He would like to see some news that gives the world context. He sees himself in trends but he is not yet able to see them a make sense of them. He is busy working so needs to consume media in short bursts on his phone and on the PC at night. 

What is the specific problem that he is trying to solve? Context to trends, intelligent and fair debate

What is it that he is looking to do in your website? watch trends, in depth debate

Specifically why would he buy from you and not from the competition? debate flow and tooling, big picture stuff

What are the repetitive questions that you constantly need to answer before he makes the final call?

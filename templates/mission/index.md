## Mission

To create a collaboration platform to enable rational debate and give broader context to the news. DebateHub is not only about current events but also about anticipating what is coming next. What is right over the horizon, potentialities and speculating about the future. Current events form trends and trends form the future. 

### Help shape this community

This is in a beta window. Now is the time to give the site admins input as to what features you would like to see. Ping therewillbewar in Discord with your ideas.

### What we are, and are not

We do not beleive that there is wisdom in crowds/masses/mobs. We are not a crowd sourcing platform. The crowd is almost always incorrect and slow to recognize trends. When individuals have insight the masses are incredulous of these visionaries. The more ahead of their time those with insight are, the more the crowd mocks them. This is a site for those who have insight and appreciate others that have it also.   

No ideas are too unconvential as long as you have solid evidence and reasoning. 

### Group is it's own worst enemy

Much like [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/writings/herecomeseverybody/group_enemy.html) I believe a group is it's own worst enemy. In that essay he identifies multiple ways in which on-line communities get derailed as they grow. In that essay he identifies negative social patterns which can be avoided and which will strengthen the group.  

Social patterns this site will try to avoid:

 - Diluting the content for mass appeal.
 - The vilification of ideas and opinions. 

A little more on the vilification of ideas...

> "So even if someone is not really your enemy, identifying them as an enemy can cause a pleasant sense of group cohesion. And groups often gravitate towards members who are the most paranoid and make them leaders, because those are the people who are best at identifying external enemies. " - Clay Shirky

We can see the vilification of ideas writ large in US politics right now. This results in groups planting flags and rallying around certain positions. While it does much for group cohesion it results in a reduction of diversity of opinion. I have a firm belief that this is why we don't really have many new political ideas. We don't have enough humility to admit the weaknesses and contradictions in our own beliefs. We think we can model the world and completely understand how it operates and we cling to certain principles. Then we apply those principles everywhere and ignore the contradictions. What we need to do is open our minds and try new things. My hope is that I can further this goal with this platform. 


### Ground Rules

Basically no trolling and stay on topic. If you must troll then keep it witty fairly clean. Name calling and cursing will not generally be tolerated. This isn't twitter.  

Continuous improvement. If you have suggestions or opinions then don't keep it to yourself. Use the contact link or ping therewillbewar in discord.

A diversity of opinion is encouraged.  

The site admins will handle the rest.

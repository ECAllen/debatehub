## The problem isn't the mainstream media... it is us

The mainstream media (refered to as the msm in this article) is often villified for problems that have to do with the people themselves. The media outlets are fundamentally businesses which have to make a profit. We often do not look at them like this but rather treat them as a information utility instead of the businesses that they are. This leads to fundamental misunderstanding of what we should expect from the msm.


The first point is that the msm as a business needs to attract eyeballs. Imagine the amount of money it takes to run the New York Times or one of the major news outlets. To run an organization of that magnitutude it seems to me you could take one of two strategies: be middle of the road and non-partisan or be very partisan and play into the biases of your audience. The major networks such as NBC and ABC try to be bland as possible in order not to offend. Fox news and MSNBC do the partisan approach. Because this country is so bifurcated and there are not many moderates there is a backlash for networks trying to be balanced. They are simply seen as bland and coporate. 


Given the above we shouldn't see the msm as a homogenous entity. When news personalities reference the msm, it should be seen in terms of their own agenda rather than any reality of media bias. The media bias is towards their advertisers and need to make a profit rather than any sense of manipulation. In order to play into their audiences's filter bubble you will notice that websites will often omit stories. For instance you will find stories on HuffPo that you don't find in Drudge and vice versa.


Now I want to be clear on something. I have criticized the msm for being driven by profit and advertising. Do not misunderstand me, I am not against capitalism or advertising or any silly idea like that. I am simply saying that most of the behaviour of the msm can be seen as serving the masses. Most discussions of the msm treat it as if it is a top down system system where the msm manipulate the audiences beliefs and fears. It is really the other way around. Most media outlets are beholden to their ratings and they chase them regardless of ideology. So when you hear someone decry the msm you should really be scepticale. The msm is us.

## Things I like about Trump
(published 08/26/17)

Actually I hate Trump… OK not really hate but I dislike him and he represents many of the aspects that I hate about American politics. Living in NYC I used to see a lot of Trump in the local media. The funny thing is that I wasn’t really aware of his political ambitions or ideas until he announced his candidacy. Then when I started paying attention I realized that his viewpoints were basically straight from right-wing talk radio and news. As his campaign progressed it confirmed my fears about what the American people really wanted. Also unlike most people I felt that both Trump and Sanders both represented demagoguery and populism. Trump with his rallies and constant blame of the mainstream media. Bernie with his unrealistic policies and promises. If you look at them both, they were also more in line with the news and talk radio pundits compared to the other candidates in their respective parties.

Regardless there are some things that I like about Trump. These maybe things that might be useful to our political discourse in the future. Here they are in no particular order:

- Trump killed two political dynasties: the Bushes and the Clintons. He didn’t really take out Hillary but rather drove a nail in the coffin. Both the Bushes and the Clintons needed to go. I think a lot of Americans on both sides felt that way.

- Trump proved that you can be outspent by your opponents and still win. In the beginning of the Republican primaries everyone thought that Jeb Bush had the nomination because he raised so much money. They thought Trump would never beat the others because he didn’t have that much cash to spend. Also they constantly said he was running out of money. He proved them wrong. Then when he went up against Hillary and a lot of left-wing pundits thought she would win because she would simply outspend him. Again wrong.

- Trump proved a politician can speak their mind unapologetically. I know many people who read this wish he would just shut up but I hope he can pave the way for politicians to speak openly and sincerely without apology. It is nice when the say what you know they are thinking anyways. Before Trump they would say what you know they feel but then follow-up with an apology the next day. Really the apology was just cover to say what they really felt.

- Trump proved you can be against the foreign wars/nation building and still win. This one is going to be a little harder to justify considering what has been happening lately but if you remember during the campaign he made numerous mentions that he was against nation building. Apparently before the campaign he also tweeted that we should withdraw from Afghanistan. He was a strange mix of militarism with nods to non-interventionism. Actually a lot of Libertarians were excited about him because if you ignored what he said about a strong military then you make yourself believe that he might be against these foreign wars. Unfortunately like many things about that campaign it was a political Rorschach test.

- Trump proved that a candidate can take on their parties establishment. I bet Bernie wish he had done that.


A lot of the points I made can go in both positive or negative directions. Honestly given the current trajectory of our country I am inclined to think they will go negatively. What also worries me is that there might be someone watching Trump’s blunders and realizing that he if wasn’t such a clown then the American public could be played. That person could get much further and possibly concentrate more executive power.

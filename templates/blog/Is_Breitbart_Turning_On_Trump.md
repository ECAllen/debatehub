## Is Breitbart turning on Trump?
(08/22/2017)

Bannon has been out of the Whitehouse for a few days now. When he exited he says he is [going to war for Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-18/bannon-says-he-s-going-to-war-for-trump-after-white-house-exit). However it was not clear from his statement whether he meant Trump or Trump's campaign agenda. [Ben Shapiro](http://www.dailywire.com/podcasts/19983/ep-366-everyones-nazi-now) (who used to work for Bannon) conjectured in his podcast that Bannon is a fighter and would turn on Trump if it benefited Bannon's populist agenda. It looks like this might be happening.

Trump has already alienated some mainstream Republicans. If he alienates his base, will he eventually court the Democrats?

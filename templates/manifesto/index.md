## Mission

One sentence

### Group is it's own worst enemy

In the words of Clay Shirky I believe a group is it's own worst enemy. 

Patterns to avoid:

sex talk

The identification and vilification of external enemies

"So even if someone isn't really your enemy, identifying them as an enemy can cause a pleasant sense of group cohesion. And groups often gravitate towards members who are the most paranoid and make them leaders, because those are the people who are best at identifying external enemies. "

Religious veneration... the group has a set of tenets that cannot be violated.

### Ground Rules

Per Clay Sharky  four things to design for

"1.) If you were going to build a piece of social software to support large and long-lived groups, what would you design for? The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in. "

2.) Second, you have to design a way for there to be members in good standing. Have to design some way in which good works get recognized. The minimal way is, posts appear with identity. You can do more sophisticated things like having formal karma or "member since." 

3.) Three, you need barriers to participation. This is one of the things that killed Usenet. You have to have some cost to either join or participate, if not at the lowest level, then at higher levels. There needs to be some kind of segmentation of capabilities. 

4.) And, finally, you have to find a way to spare the group from scale. Scale alone kills conversations, because conversations require dense two-way conversations. In conversational contexts, Metcalfe's law is a drag. The fact that the amount of two-way connections you have to support goes up with the square of the users means that the density of conversation falls off very fast as the system scales even a little bit. You have to have some way to let users hang onto the less is more pattern, in order to keep associated with one another. 

### Ciommunitree Story

"They appeared uninspired by the relatively intellectual and spiritual air of the ongoing
debates, and proceeded to express their dissatisfaction in ways appropriate to their
age, sex, and language abilities. Within a short time the Tree was jammed with obscene
and scatological messages. There was no easy way to monitor them as they arrived, and no
easy way to remove them once they were in the system. . . .

Within a few months, the Tree had expired, choked to death with what one participant
called `the consequences of freedom of expression.' During the years of its operation,
however, several young participants took the lessons and implications of such a
community away with them, and proceeded to write their own systems. Within a few years
there was a proliferation of on-line virtual communities of somewhat less visionary
character but vastly superior message-handling capability. . . .

The visionary character of CommuniTree's electronic ontology proved an obstacle to the
Tree's survival. Ensuring privacy in all aspects of the Tree's structure and enabling
unlimited access to all conferences did not work in a context of increasing availability
of terminals to young men who did not necessarily share the Tree gods' ideas of what
counted as community. As one Tree veteran put it, `The barbarian hordes mowed us down.'
Thus, in practice, surveillance and control proved necessary adjuncts to maintaining
order in the virtual community."

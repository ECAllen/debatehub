			<li>Q. Why do you only use social media for authentication services?</li>
			<li>A. Website security is hard! It is something best left to specialist. Don't believe me? Watch this video of a Comp Sci professor cracking passwords in real time:

				A lot of sites try to implement a authentication themselves and then leave their users vulnerable. Even if you use third party code to implement authentication you can easily create vulnerabilities by failing to setup the backend correcty. The social media companies have the deep pockets to secure and defend their authentication systems. Even with all those resources they still suffer data breaches. If they have issues then there really is no hope for a small website to defend themselves against hackers.

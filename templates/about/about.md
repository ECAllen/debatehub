## The problem

DebateHub is a platform for solving and age old problem on the internet. How to get people to truely communincate and lift the discussion. Most venues on the internet such as Facebook or various chat platforms do nor encourage meaningful communication. They tend to do the following:

1. encourage filter bubbles
2. crowd bias, clustering
3. encourage tangential discussion and allow meningful debates to get derailed
4. they rely on karma schemes which favor righteous comments rather than informative ones
5. they adopt aspects of mob mentality which tramples controversial and taboo viewpoints
6. this is the modern internet where everything is online, modern platforms should aloow users to cite source and force people to backup their arguments
7. they confuse time binding comments (more on that later)

What they don't really get is that a platform needs to fit the level of discussions/debates that you want (TODO awkward). A platform that is created for mass consumption is really created to sell ads and cannot elevate discussion. 

First the platform must be collabrative not social... what does that mean? It means that a purely democratic model will not work. Reddit is the perfect example of this:

TODO insert shot of reddit comments with filler

Not everyone has to chime in and not what everyone has to say needs to be posted and saved for long term viewing. If you analyze the above discussion you will see posts like "TODO insert some pithy statement from the above discussion". These are the kind of statements that you see in chat rooms and are not really relevant. Reddit tries to correct for this by burying them in nested strucutres (TODO awkward). Reddit is trying to push ads so this works for them. The strucutre encourages social comments meant to be funny and snarky rather than informative. Ideally a post could be both funny and informative.  

This helps a little but it is a odd mix of forum like behaviour and chat like. One of the problems here is that two differnt time frames are mixed. When you are chatting in a chat room it is more like a cocktail party(<- really?). Comments can be witty. You dont really expect them to be saved permanently and you usually wont go back and look at them later. The exception would be a technical dicussion. Chats can meander and split into private chat rooms. Forums and email lists represent a longer time frame. First it is longer form. They take the form of a challenge response (TODO awk). They are expected to be saved and viewied later. However they are not a document per se. They are still a discussion. They can be thought of as a long form discussion.  They are alos a little different from chat in that repsonses are edited. The particiapnats experience it as a discussion. When readers look at them later they are expected to reread the entire discussion and dig out the answeres they are seeking. The next time frame is very long. This would be things like blog posts and Wiki pages. They are edited and long form. They usually only include one point of view or bias. However they improve upon forums in that they are distilled knowledge. Wiki's do allow feedback but they do not foster debate. Check out the evolution page on Wikipedia. 

## How do we fix this?

1. minimum length posts
2. sources
3. We are not silicon valley group thinkers. We are not Stanford grads trying to make a another bike sharing service or a Vegan recipe site. 

## The mission

Create a platform which can sustain our group and revolutionize collaboration. A platform which allows common men/women to implement collaborative models.
